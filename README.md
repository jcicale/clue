###2. Rules

	2.1 Gameplay - Turn order

		1. Miss Scarlet goes first

		2. Remaining players begin clockwise around the board

		3. Order is as follows: Miss Scarlet -> Colonel Mustard -> Mrs. White -> Mr. Green -> Mrs Peacock -> Professor Plum
			(e.g., if Miss Scarlet is not playing, Colonel Mustard goes first) 

	2.2 Gameplay - Moving about the board
		1. Rather than use dice to move about the board, you may directly enter any room that is adjacent to the room you are in
			a. Kitchen may access Ballroom, Dining Room, or Study
			b. Ballroom may access Kitchen or Conservatory
			c. Conservatory may access Ballroom, Billiard Room, or Lounge
			d. Billiard Room may access Conservatory or Library
			e. Library may access Billiard Room or Study
			f. Study may access Library, Hall, or Kitchen
			g. Hall may access Study or Lounge
			h. Lounge may access Hall, Dining Room, or Conservatory
			i. Dining Room may access Lounge or Kitchen

		2. At start, characters may enter only rooms they start near (as follows):
			a. Miss Scarlet may enter Lounge or Hall
			b. Colonel Mustard may enter Dining Room or Lounge
			c. Mrs. White may enter Kitchen or Ballroom
			d. Mr. Green may enter Ballroom or Conservatory
			e. Mrs. Peacock may enter Conservatory or Billiard Room
			f. Professor Plum may enter Library or Study

		3. To begin, Player will enter the name of the room he/she chooses
			a. If a valid choice, Player moves to that room
			b. If not valid, Player is asked to try again

		4. At start of a Player's turn, he/she will be prompted whether to move (M) or make an accusation (A) - see 2.3.5 and 2.4 below

	2.3 Gameplay - Making a suggestion
		1. After choosing which room to enter, Player token is moved to that room

		2. Player is prompted whether he/she would like to make a suggestion (y/n)

		3. If y: Player will be prompted to enter name of suspect followed by name of weapon
			a. The  suspect token and weapon token entered are moved into the current room
			b. Search cards of each CP in order
			c. If any card that a CP has refutes Player's suggestion, this is revealed to Player, and Player's turn ends
			d. If no CP card refutes Player's suggestion, Player may either end turn or make an accusation

		4. If n: Player's turn ends

		5. NOTE: The only way to make a suggestion at the beginning of a turn (i.e., without moving to a new room) is if your token was brought to that room by someone else's suggestion, rather than as a result of your own move
			a. Therefore, if your token is moved by a CP suggestion, you have three options at beginning of turn: move (M), accusation (A), or suggestion (S)

	2.4 Gameplay - Making an accusation
		1. Player may make an accusation at any point in the game at the beginning of his/her turn

		2. Player does not have to be in the room currently to make an accusation, so the Player must enter all three fields

		3. If Player's accusation is correct: Player wins

		4. If Player's accusation is correct: Player loses
